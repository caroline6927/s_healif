## Goal of this Shiny App Project



The ultimate goal is to customize exercise schedule for you.

For example, you are a 24-year-old male office worker stays in Foster City and works in Redwood City.
You probably ride a scooter to your office and ride back home.
You would spend about 60 minutes on the way, which is counted to your daily active minutes.
I would suggest a total of 90 active minutes per day to keep healthy!
So your weekly work & exercise time would look like this.

A Demo Plot is on next page.

## Exercise Plan for the Weekends!

As you can see in the plot, you should get more exercise during weekends.
If you keen to do some vigorious exercise, you should take note of your maximum heart rate, which should not exceed (220 - your age).
